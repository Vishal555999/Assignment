Test Strategy-->
This is a simple TestNg framework i have used.
Used testNg for the page design and create multiple test cases for each test cases.
and run this test using testNg annotation(@Test)
In @beforemethod we have open URl and maximize the window and same in @aftermethod driver will quit after each test case execution
for some element like consent radio button and submit we have use explicit wait to make load element properly.

Also used softassert class to assert the test cases.
